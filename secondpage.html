        <h1>This is my second page here</h1>
        <abbr>This page is mainly gonna be me testing as many new tags as possible</abbr>
        <br>
        <button>This button for example does literally nothing, it's here for fun</button>
        <h6>Unless..... nah there's no way it does anything right?</h6>
        <em>I mean come on, a website this simple wouldn't have anything happen for a basic button</em>
        <header>Like for gods sake, most of these tags don't even make sense here</header>
        <h5>Anyways, we can get back to the first page since this one is kinda random</h5>
        <code>In the previous html file, I mentioned how much I like pizza, and I cannot stress enough how much I love pizza</code>
        <br>
        <sub>If you knew how to make a good pizza, I would follow you through hell and back in trade for pizza</sub>
        <br>
        <i>I used to know how to skateboard, but after a bad accident I pretty much have been scared off from ever riding one again</i><br>
        <strong>This is a strong tag, it makes stuff strong and pretty buff</strong>
        <address>This is an address tag, which is supposed to be used to put owner information of the website</address>
        <mark>What does this do?</mark><br>
        <q>Oh, it highlights something that's pretty cool</q><p>Said Omar as he typed the code</p>
        <del>This tag puts a cross through the text. It's funny that it's called a del tag, since it makes more sense to just remove the text from the website</del>
        <br<<s>This tag does the same thing but just has a different tag. Why must HTML be so weird?</s>
        <br>
        <sup>Anyways, this concludes the second page, which pretty much just consists of me rambling. Very cool :D</sup>
