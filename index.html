            <li>

              Science minor
            </li>
            <li>I have around 4 cats</li>

            <li>
              I cook a pretty damn good Chicken Alfredo, and also Fettucine
              Alfredo
            </li>
            <li>My favorite food by a mile is pizza, I love pizza</li>
            <li>I knew how to ride a skateboard</li>
            <li>I am into cars, my favorite car is a Nissan GTR R35</li>
            <li>
              I originally went into college due to me really getting into
              machine learning. I mainly was interested in Video Frame
              Interpolation and Image Enhancement & Upscaling
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "videoarea">
          <p>
            I used to upscale a lot of anime clips, here are a couple of before and after frames from some of those clips.

        <p>These are my cats</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Checkers</li>
          <li>Gremlin</li>
          <li>Blueberry</li>
          <li>Grumpy</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Below is a picture of my cat</h4>
        <img src="checkers.jpg" alt="Picture of my cat sleeping" />
        <p>
          All the cats I have right now are stray cats, and checkers is the only
          one that stays inside our house. We found him in our backyard and he
          was immediately friendly with us. I believe that he used to be owned
          by other people but they abandoned him or something. I love him so
          much and I am happy he walked into my life.
