<h4>Some cool things aboout me</h4>
<ul>
    
    <li>I am a Computer Science Student who is also pursuing a Data Science minor</li>
    <li>I have around 4 cats</li>

    <li>I cook a pretty damn good Chicken Alfredo, and also Fettucine Alfredo</li>
    <li>My favorite food by a mile is pizza, I love pizza</li>
    <li>I knew how to ride a skateboard</li>
    <li>I a into cars, my favorite car is a Nissan GTR R35</li>
    <li>I originally went into college due to me really getting into machine learning. I mainly was interested in Video Frame Interpolation and Image Enhancement & Upscaling</li><br>

    
</ul>
I used to upscale and increase the frame rates of a lot of my favorite anime clips, mainly DBZ clips, but Toei animation nuked my 
    account with a ton of copyright claims. I think that's pretty lame considering the videos were at most 5 minutes, but at least they
    kept my favorite video, which is the one I linked below.

<p>These are my cats</p>
<ol>
    <li>Checkers</li>
    <li>Gremlin</li>
    <li>Blueberry</li>
    <li>Grumpy</li>
</ol>
<h4>Below is a picture of my cat</h4>
<img src ="checkers.jpg" alt="Picture of my cat sleeping">
<p> All the cats I have right now are stray cats, and checkers is the only one that stays inside our house. We found him in our backyard
    and he was immediately friendly with us. I believe that he used to be owned by other people but they abandoned him or something. I love him so much
    and I am happy he walked into my life.
