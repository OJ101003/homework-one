                I originally went into college for CS because I was into
                machine learning. I mainly was interested in Video Frame
                Interpolation and Image Enhancement & Upscaling

            I used to upscale a lot of anime clips, here are a couple of before

            All the cats I have right now are stray cats, and checkers is the
            only one that stays inside our house. We found him in our backyard
            and he was immediately friendly with us. I believe that he used to
            be owned by other people but they abandoned him or something. I love
            him so much and I am happy he walked into my life.
